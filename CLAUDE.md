# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**RocketMap** is a startup interactive planbook copilot - a "Playable Business Model Engine" that transforms business strategy into a living system. It enables users to validate assumptions, detect contradictions, and stress-test their startup ideas through AI-powered analysis.

### Core Philosophy

- AI analyzes structural coherence across business model components
- AI extracts hidden assumptions from user inputs
- AI simulates shock scenarios and reveals fragility points
- AI acts as an adversarial validator, not just a content generator

### MVP Scope

1. **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** - 9-block interactive board with expandable deep-dive layers
2. **Multi-Layer Architecture** - Each BMC block expands into specialized analysis layers:
   - **Layer 0 (Canvas):** The 9-block BMC grid overview
   - **Layer 1 (Block Detail):** Expanded view with AI-generated structured outputs (draft, assumptions, risks, questions)
   - **Layer 2 (Deep Dive):** Block-specific research modules (e.g., Customer Segments → Market Research)
3. **Per-block AI Copilot** - LLM assists within each block for content generation, analysis, and validation
4. **System-level AI** - Cross-block reasoning that flags contradictions, missing links, and logical gaps (Consistency Checker)

The critical differentiator is **multi-layer depth + cross-block reasoning** - not just filling boxes, but drilling into each block with specialized research tools while validating coherence across the entire business model.

## Architecture & Key Concepts

### Design System: "Calm Until Critical"

The interface maintains a neutral, professional state during normal operation. Visual emphasis (chromatic effects, glows, animations) emerges only when blocks become fragile or require attention.

**State-Based Visual Language:**

- **Calm:** Muted gray, subtle holographic borders, allows focus
- **Healthy/Validated:** Green-blue shimmer with subtle glow
- **Warning/Fragile:** Amber-gold with rainbow edge highlights
- **Critical/Collapse Risk:** Hot pink-red with chromatic aberration and pulsing glow
- **AI Analysis Active:** Cyan-purple holographic gradient with scanning effects

### Multi-Layer Block Architecture

Each BMC block supports expanding into deeper analysis layers:

**Customer Segments → Market Research Layer:**

- TAM / SAM / SOM estimation (with AI-assisted sizing)
- Market segmentation (demographic, psychographic, behavioral, geographic)
- Customer personas generation
- Competitor landscape mapping
- Market trends and growth drivers

**Other blocks will have their own deep-dive layers** (planned):

- Value Propositions → Feature-benefit mapping, competitive positioning matrix
- Revenue Streams → Pricing strategy analysis, unit economics modeling
- Channels → Channel effectiveness analysis, customer journey mapping
- Key Resources → Resource gap analysis, build-vs-buy assessment
- Cost Structure → Cost modeling, break-even analysis
- Key Activities → Process mapping, capability assessment
- Key Partnerships → Partnership evaluation framework
- Customer Relationships → Retention strategy, lifecycle mapping

### AI Architecture

**Two levels of LLM integration:**

1. **Block-level AI Copilot** - Operates within a single block or its deep-dive layer:

   - Content drafting and refinement
   - Research assistance (e.g., market sizing calculations for Customer Segments)
   - Structured output generation (assumptions, risks, questions)
   - Layer-specific analysis (e.g., TAM estimation, persona generation)

2. **System-level AI (Consistency Checker)** - Operates across the entire canvas:
   - Cross-block contradiction detection
   - Missing link identification
   - Coherence scoring
   - Suggested fixes with specific block references

AI prompts receive the **entire canvas as context** but focus on the selected block/layer while referencing others for consistency checking.

### Data Structure

Each BMC block is stored as structured JSON containing:

- Block type (e.g., "Customer Segments", "Value Propositions")
- User-entered content (per canvas mode: BMC / Lean)
- AI-generated analysis (assumptions, risks, questions)
- Deep-dive layer data (block-specific, e.g., market research results)
- Confidence level (Low/Med/High)
- State (calm/healthy/warning/critical)
- Connections to other blocks

```

### Styling Approach

- **CSS Variables** in `globals.css` for colors, states, and chromatic effects
- **Tailwind** for layout, spacing, responsive design
- **Radix Theme tokens** for component styling via props
- **Custom animations** for holographic effects, state transitions, and glows

Key classes:

- `.chromatic-border` - Multi-color gradient borders
- `.glow-{state}` - State-based shadow effects (calm/healthy/warning/critical/ai)
- `.holographic-bg` / `.holographic-strong` - Gradient backgrounds with shimmer
- `.glass-morphism` - Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur
- `.state-transition` - Smooth state changes (300ms/500ms)

### Theme Configuration

Radix Theme is configured in [app/layout.tsx](app/layout.tsx:37-43) with:

- `appearance: "dark"`
- `accentColor: "iris"` (purple-blue for holographic feel)
- `grayColor: "gray"` (neutral surfaces)
- `radius: "large"` (modern curves)

## Development Guidelines

### AI Prompt Engineering

**CRITICAL:** All LLM integrations must include the System Prompt from [lib/ai/PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md](lib/ai/PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md).

When implementing AI features, prompts must:

1. Include the System Prompt (enforces design constraints globally)
2. Send the entire canvas state as context
3. Instruct the model to focus on the selected block while cross-referencing others
4. Return structured JSON output with all required fields
5. Reference design variables in suggestions (var(--state-_), var(--font-_), .glow-\* classes)
6. Never suggest fonts outside the three approved typefaces
7. Be versioned and stored in the repository

**Example LLM suggestion:**

```
❌ BAD: "Use Arial for labels and make it red"
✅ GOOD: "Apply .font-display-small (Crimson Text, weight 600) with var(--state-warning) (#f59e0b) and .glow-warning class"
```

### Consistency Checker (System-Level AI)

The killer feature. After users fill 2-3 blocks, it should:

- Compare customer segments with channels and value propositions
- Validate revenue streams match cost structures
- Flag vague or contradictory statements
- Suggest missing connections between blocks
- Cross-reference deep-dive layer data (e.g., does TAM support the revenue projections?)

Output format:

- List of contradictions with specific block references
- Severity indicators (minor/major/critical)
- Suggested fixes or validation questions

### Market Research Layer (Customer Segments Deep-Dive)

**First deep-dive layer to implement.** When the Customer Segments block is expanded:

1. **TAM/SAM/SOM Calculator** - AI-assisted market sizing with source citations
2. **Segmentation Builder** - Define segments by demographics, psychographics, behavior, geography
3. **Persona Generator** - AI creates detailed customer personas from segment data
4. **Market Size Validation** - Cross-reference with industry data and benchmarks
5. **Competitive Landscape** - Map competitors within each segment

Each sub-module has its own LLM integration for research assistance, with results feeding back into the main Customer Segments block content and influencing cross-block consistency checks.

### Visual Feedback Signals

Two simple indicators make the system feel "alive":

1. **Confidence meter per block** (Low/Med/High) - based on specificity of content and depth of research
2. **Red flags count** - aggregated from AI-detected risks + contradictions
3. **Depth indicator** - Shows how many layers have been explored per block

### Animation Performance

- Use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (already implemented in globals.css)
- Use `will-change` sparingly (only for active animations)
- Debounce pan/zoom interactions

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels for canvas controls
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- High contrast text even with chromatic effects (white on dark backgrounds)

## Current State (as of 2026-02-14)

The codebase currently has:

- ✅ Radix UI + Tailwind setup complete
- ✅ Dark theme with chromatic effects system implemented
- ✅ Typography system (Lexend Deca, Crimson Text w/ bold for small sizes, Geist Mono)
- ✅ State-based glow and animation utilities
- ✅ Landing page with auth flow
- ✅ Appwrite integration (auth, database)
- ✅ Dashboard with canvas list and onboarding
- ✅ BMC grid layout (9 blocks) with BlockCell components
- ✅ Canvas view with BMC/Lean mode toggle
- ✅ Block definitions with grid positioning
- ✅ Type system for canvas data (BlockType, BlockState, CanvasMode, BlockData)

Next implementation steps:

1. Add block expand/detail view (Layer 1 - structured AI outputs per block)
2. Build Market Research deep-dive layer for Customer Segments (Layer 2 - TAM, segmentation, personas)
3. Integrate LLM for per-block AI copilot (content drafting, analysis)
4. Integrate LLM for system-level Consistency Checker (cross-block reasoning)
5. Add AI analysis panel UI (assumptions, risks, questions display)
6. Persist deep-dive layer data to Appwrite
7. Build additional deep-dive layers for other blocks

## Demo Flow (3-minute pitch)

1. Start with a vague startup idea
2. Fill 2-3 blocks quickly with basic content
3. Click "AI Analyze" on one block → show assumptions + risks + tests
4. Expand Customer Segments → deep-dive into Market Research → AI estimates TAM/SAM/SOM
5. Click "Run Consistency Check" → flags contradictions (e.g., TAM doesn't support revenue projections)
6. Fix blocks based on feedback → rerun → fewer red flags, higher confidence
7. End message: "This is a judgment amplifier, not a template filler"

The goal is to show **depth (multi-layer drill-down) + breadth (cross-block reasoning)** within minutes.
